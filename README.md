# DTULibrary
Git link is https://github.com/SEGroupE/DTULibrary.git

Requirements:

MySQL database
JDK 10 or higher

Installation:

The application requires a database running, therefor create a database.
 
If any values differs from this DTULibrary\Mazemap\src\main\resources\static\application.properties need to reflect the actual values database name and user. The password gets pulled from an environment variable called MazeMapMYSQLDBPASSWORD, which needs to have itâ€™s value set to the same value as your database password.

The String baseUrl under /main/com/helpers/ServerUrl.java needs to be the local address or where the application is to be deployed,http://localhost:8080would be the normal address for local setup.  The same needs to be done to /main/resources/static/mazemap.htmlwith the attribute baseUrlInput, which is at the first line of the <body>. The /main/resources/appli-cation.properties should have the server.port set to 8080 and all server.ssl should be outcommented. You can use https and port  8443, but that will require installation of a certificate, that https requires, this can be generated by using keytool from Java1. The server.ssl values should then match the certificate.

The webapp is a maven project using springboot, packaging as a war file to deploy directly to a Tomcat server. 
However for local use you do not need to create a Tomcat server, springboot will create one, when running.

The maven command for running the app is mvn spring-boot:run or mvn clean spring-boot:run to create a clean install.
using eclipse for instance and running as a maven project the goal of the run configuration should be spring-boot:run
The base directory for the project is ${workspace_loc://DTULibrary/Mazemap}

Feel free to ask for further assistance with the webapp.
